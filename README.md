# LyricsGeneration

Writing lyrics has always been a challenging task as it involves not only creativity but also inspiration. With the introduction and development of various neural network-based methodologies that have shown quite a promise in applications to a wide range other fields, it is promising to see how these new technologies can cater to the domain of musical creativity. Even though there has been significant amount of research done focusing on musical composition, it is not the same for musical song writing.
 This project demonstrates the effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks in an efforts to generate song lyrics. The goal of this project is to try out different model
architectures and understand how recurrent Neural networks are able to learn the
song lyric structures.
The experiments were conducted on an English Song dataset.	
In addition to that, a web-based inference tool is developed, which allows us to easily generate lyrics when we provide input.

#RNN

A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a class of artificial neural network where
connections between units form a directed graph along a sequence. This allows it
to exhibit dynamic temporal behavior for a time sequence. Unlike feedforward
neural networks, RNNs can use their internal state (memory) to process
sequences of inputs. This makes them applicable to tasks such as unsegmented,
connected handwriting recognition or speech recognition.
Recurrent Neural Network comes into the picture when any model needs context
to be able to provide the output based on the input. Sometimes the context is the
single most important thing for the model to predict the most appropriate output.
